# Accessible Tabs

A webpage with multiple tab groups fully compliant with [WAI ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabpanel/) specifications.

The purpose of this solution is to handle multiple tab groups rendered on a single page, where active tabs can retain their state in a similar manner to native HTML element including back/forward navigation and refresh.

## Getting Started

Start with cloning repository and changing current directory to repository folder.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/LouayH/accessible-tabs

$ cd accessible-tabs
```

Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install the required packages to start the project.

Finally, run `npm start` or `yarn start` to start the server, the browser should open automatically, if not open [http://127.0.0.1:8080/](http://127.0.0.1:8080/)

`8080` is the default port, if it was in use, refer to your terminal to get the used port.

## Unit Tests

Run `npm test` or `yarn test` to launch the test runner.
